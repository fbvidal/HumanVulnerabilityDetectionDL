# Detection of Areas with Human Vulnerability Using Public Satellite Images and Deep Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the project titled **"Detection of Areas with Human Vulnerability Using Public Satellite Images and Deep Learning"**. The goal of this project is to identify regions where individuals are living under precarious conditions and facing neglected basic needs, a situation often seen in Brazil. This concept is referred to as "human vulnerability" and is exemplified by families living in inadequate shelters or on the streets in both urban and rural areas.

Focusing on the Federal District of Brazil as the research area, this project aims to develop two novel public datasets consisting of satellite images. The datasets contain imagery captured at 50m and 100m scales, covering regions of human vulnerability, traditional areas, and improperly disposed waste sites.

The project also leverages these datasets for training deep learning models, including **YOLOv7** and other state-of-the-art models, to perform image segmentation. A comparative analysis is conducted between the models using two training strategies: training from scratch with random weight initialization and fine-tuning using pre-trained weights through **transfer learning**.

### Key Achievements

- Two new satellite image datasets focusing on human vulnerability and improperly disposed waste sites, available in public domains.
- Comparison of image segmentation models, including **YOLOv7** and **Segmentation Models**, with performance metrics.
- Best F1-scores: 0.55 for **YOLOv7** and 0.64 for **Segmentation Models**.

This repository provides the code, models, and data pipelines used for training, evaluation, and performance comparison of these deep learning models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- YOLOv7 framework
- Segmentation Models library
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Evaluate the trained models and compare performance:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model yolov7 --dataset test_data_path
   ```

## Dataset

The datasets consist of satellite imagery at 50m and 100m resolution, capturing:
- Areas of human vulnerability
- Traditional areas
- Improperly disposed waste sites

    note        = "People living in precarious conditions and with their basic needs neglected is an unfortunate reality in Brazil. This scenario will be approached in this work according to the concept of \"human vulnerability\" and can be exemplified through families who live in inadequate shelters, without basic structures and on the streets of urban or rural centers. Therefore, assuming the Federal District as the research scope, this project proposes to develop two new databases to be made available publicly, considering the map scales of 50m and 100m, and composed by satellite images of human vulnerability areas,
regions treated as traditional and waste disposed inadequately. Furthermore, using these image bases, trainings were done with the YOLOv7 model and other deep learning models for image segmentation. By adopting an exploratory approach, this work compares the results of different image segmentation models and training strategies, using random weight initialization
(from scratch) and pre-trained weights (transfer learning). Thus, the present work was able to reach maximum F1
score values of 0.55 for YOLOv7 and 0.64 for other segmentation models."
